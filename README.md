# marker

Tool for visualizing parts of your codebase Claude has stored within a session log.

![screenshot](./images/screenshot.png)

## What it does

- Parses your project into a hierarchical symbol tree (functions, structs, classes, methods, etc.)
- Monitors Claude Code's JSONL session logs in real time
- Colors each symbol by how deeply the agent has read it: unseen, name-only, overview, signature, or full body
- Detects when source files change and marks previously-read symbols as stale
- supports parsing [Serena MCP](https://github.com/oraios/serena) symbol artifacts.

## Todo
- multi agent heirchies
- Multi session visualization

## Supported languages

**Tree-sitter parsing:**
- Rust
- Python

## Building from source

Requires Rust 1.70+.

```
cargo build --release
```

## Installing through Cargo

```
cargo install claude-marker
```

## Usage

```

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--project`, `-p` | Path to the project root (required) |
| `--dump` | Print symbol tree to stdout and exit |
| `--serena` | Use Serena's LSP symbol cache instead of tree-sitter |
| `--session`, `-s` | Session ID to track (auto-detects latest) |
| `--log-dir` | Path to Claude Code log directory (auto-derived) |

marker -p . --serena
```
